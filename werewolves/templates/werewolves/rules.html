<h1><b>Rules for the Werewolves Game</b></h1>
<br>
<h3><b>Players</b></h3>
Werewolves is a board game with 6 players. The players are divided into two camps: 2 in the Wolf camp and 4 in the Good People camp. 
<br>
<br>
<h3><b>Player Roles</b></h3>
Players in the Wolf camp only have Wolf roles. On the other hand, the Good People Camp consists of 3 different roles: 2 Villagers, 
1 Seer and 1 Guard. 
<br>
<br>
<h3><b>Game Procedures</b></h3>
The game has two phases: Night and Day. 
<br>
<br>
<h3><b>Night</b></h3>
At Night, players in the Wolf camp discuss among themselves and select a player to kill in the Good People camp. Players in the 
Wolf camp have their identities hidden from the other players. Next, the Seer can check the camp of one player. After that, the 
Guard is told of which player is killed that night and can choose whether to protect the player or not. If the player who is killed 
is not protected by the Guard, that player will have to leave the game.
<br>
<br>
<h3><b>Day</b></h3>
During the Day, all players are notified of whether a players is killed last night and who that player is. Each player will make a 
speech and then all players will vote for one person. The player who gets the most votes has to leave the game. The players will 
receive system messages, make speeches and chat with each other using a chat box.
